# aws-security
This repo has recommendation and details with respect to AWS cloud's security.

As a best practise, its recommended to delete default VPCs and create custom VPCs with better 
security control - even not in use, its better to delete default VPC from security point of view. 
You can use the clean up script(DefaultVPCCleanUp.py) from this repo to delete default VPCs in your AWS account.
